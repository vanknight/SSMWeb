                <h1>条款和条件</h1>
                <div class="content-page">
                    <p>01. Unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Seller, the purchase price of
                        the goods herein agreed to be sold (hereinafter called “the said goods”)
                        shall be paid for in cash in US dollar currency before or at the time when
                        the said goods shall be delivered in accordance with this Contract.</p>
                    <p>
                        如果没有得到卖方书面同意，本协议商定销售的货物（以下简称“标的货物”）进货价格将以美金计价，买方应该在符合本协议的标的货物交付时或交付前用美金完成付款。</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>02. If the said goods are sold or order thereof are accepted on credit terms,
                        such sale or acceptance of order is conditional on the right of the Seller
                        to revoke and cancel such credit terms and to require cash payment for the
                        price of the said goods AND until full payment of the price the property in
                        the said goods shall not pass to the Buyer.</p>
                    <p>
                        如果标的货物是在信用证条款的基础上被卖出或接订单，那么此销售或接单有一个前提，即：卖方有权决定是否取消信用证条款并要求买方对标的货物现金付款，标的货物的所有权在买方全额付款后才会转到买方手中。</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>03. The Buyer shall bear and pay for any duty, tariff or other expenses which
                        may be imposed or the rate thereof increased after the signing of this
                        Contract by both the Buyer and Seller or acceptance of purchase order.
                    <p>买方应该承担并支付任何关税或征收的其它费用，支付接单或双方签订合约后增长的费用。</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>04. Any deposit or purchase price or part thereof paid to the Seller is not
                        refundable, and subject to condition 7(b) hereafter.</p>
                    <p>买方支付给卖方的任何押金、货款或部分货款是不可偿还的，并且遵照以下7（b）条款。</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>05. The property in the said goods shall remain with the Seller unless and
                        until the price of the said goods and/or interests, storage charges
                        insurance premium and costs expenses and other charges and moneys, as the
                        case may be, which the buyer is liable to pay herein shall have been fully
                        paid notwithstanding the risks of the said goods may have passed to the
                        Buyer and/or physical possession or custody of the said goods may have been
                        given or delivered to or taken delivery of by the Buyer.</p>
                    <p>
                        尽管标的货物的风险可能已经转移到买方手中或保管权已经交给买方，但标的货物的所有权仍归卖方所有，直到买方全额支付完成其则责任内的货款、利息、仓储费、保险费和其他一些依情况而定的费用为止。</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>06. As regards the Buyer only, the respective times herein stipulated for
                        taking delivery of and payment for the said goods shall be of the essence of
                        this Contract. The failure on the part of the Buyer to pay for the price of
                        the said goods in accordance with such stipulations relating to payment
                        thereof shall entitle the Seller to treat such failure as a repudiation of
                        this Contract by the Buyer and the Seller shall have the right to repudiate
                        further performance thereof and to recover all loss and damages suffered by
                        the Seller arising out of the Buyer’s breach of contract.</p>
                    <p>
                        关于买方，合同的关键是其中规定的移交货物的时间和付款的时间。如果买方不能按照合同付款规定对标的货物进行付款，那么卖方有权拒绝继续履行合同，并要求买方对由于买方违反合同规定而给卖方造成的损失进行赔偿。</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>07. If the Buyer shall fail to take or accept delivery of the said goods or
                        any part thereof, then on and as from the time when delivery of the said
                        goods should have been taken by the Buyer, the risks or loss or damage or
                        deterioration of the said goods from whatever cause arising shall pass to
                        and be borne by the Buyer AND the Seller (without prejudice to the
                        generality of the Seller’s rights herein and/or other rights and remedies
                        available in equity and law) at the Seller’s sole discretion shall be
                        entitled to exercise any one or more of the following options, namely :</p>
                    <p>
                        如果买方没能按时接手移交来的商品，那么任何原因引起的标的货物的风险、损失或破坏都将由买方来承担；卖方（在不损害合同规定的卖方权利或法律范围内的其它权利和补救方法的原则下）有权作出以下选择，即：</p>
                    <p>
                    <p>(a) the Seller shall be entitled to hold the said goods but entirely at the
                        risk and expenses of the Buyer for such time as the Seller shall in its sole
                        discretion see fit. In such event, the Buyer shall pay to the Seller on
                        demand all storage charges, insurance premium and interest on the price at
                        the rate of 1.5% per month calculated on a daily basis from the date when
                        the Buyer should have taken delivery of the said goods until delivery of the
                        said goods shall have been taken and the price thereof fully paid.
                        Notwithstanding the risks of the said goods shall have been passed to the
                        Buyer as aforesaid, the property in the said goods shall not pass unless and
                        until full payment of the above mentioned price charges and expenses and
                        interest shall have been fully paid;</p>
                    <p>
                        卖方有权持有标的货物，但是在此情况下完全由买方承担风险和费用。在此情况下，买方应该补偿卖方要求的所有仓储费、保险费、货物每月1.5%的利息（从买方应该接货之日起到买方买方接货并完成全部付款之日为止）。
                        虽然如上述所说，货物的的风险已经转移到买方手中，但是标的货物的所有权直到买方全部付清上述费用和利息才转移到买方手中。</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>(b) The Seller shall be entitled to treat such failure on the Buyer to take
                        delivery a repudiation of this Contract by the Buyer AND/OR to avail itself
                        the right to repudiate further performance on the part of the Seller of this
                        Contract and to forfeit any deposit money paid herein as and for liquidated
                        damages without prejudice to the rights to claim for losses and damages for
                        the Buyer’s breach of this Contract;</p>
                    <p>
                        买方可以把卖方的这种行为视为对合同的否定，或者有权拒绝继续履行合同中买方的义务，并且在不损害卖方因买方违反合同规定而申请赔偿损失的前提下，没收买方的押金以补偿已清算的损失。</p>
                    <p>
                    <p>(c) The Seller shall be entitled to (and the Buyer shall be deemed to have
                        given consent to the Seller to) sell the said goods or any part thereof by
                        public auction or by private contract on such terms and conditions and at
                        such price and/or otherwise dispose of the said goods in such other manner
                        as the Seller shall think fit without being liable to the Buyer for any loss
                        or damage which may be occasioned thereby. In such event, the Buyer shall be
                        liable to the Seller for any loss and damages the Seller may suffer,
                        including interest overdue charges and any deficiency in price and all costs
                        charges and expenses occasioned thereby.</p>
                    <p>
                        卖方有权（买方被认为同意）通过公开拍卖或私人合同方式、按照这些条款并以此价格卖掉全部或部分货物，或者卖方通过其认为合理并不用对买方可能发生的损失负责任的方式对标的货物进行处理。
                        在此情况下，买方应对卖方可能遭受的损失负责，包括利息晚付的费用、价钱的不足和可能发生的所有费用。买方应该知道并且承认：卖方必须从生产商那里获得标的货物然后再卖给合同中的买方。
                        此合同的签订有一个前提：生厂商应该在香港及时把上述货物交予卖方，以便卖方转售给买方。</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>08. The Buyer is aware of and acknowledges that the Seller has to acquire
                        and/or obtain the said goods from the manufacturers/suppliers for re‐sale to
                        the Buyer herein. This Contract is entered into on the basis and condition
                        that the manufacturers/suppliers shall deliver to the Seller in Hong Kong
                        the said goods in time to complete the re‐sale of the same to the Buyer.</p>
                    <p>
                        买方知道并认可卖方不得不从制造商/供应商处取得和/或收到标的货物用来转售给买方，制造商/供应商应该按时将标的货物交付给位于香港的卖方，以便完成转售标的货物给买方，本协议以此为基础和条件制定。</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>09. If the manufacturers/suppliers shall fail to supply the said goods to the
                        Seller in time, the Seller shall be entitled, entirely at the discretion of
                        the Seller only, to rescind this Contract without being liable to the Buyer
                        for loss or damages, if any, OR postpone the date of delivery of the said
                        goods to the Buyer.</p>
                    <p>
                        如果制造商/供应商未能按时提供标的货物给卖方，那么卖方有权废除本协议，标的货物完全任凭卖方处理，或推迟交付标的货物给买方，不用为买方的损失或损坏（若有的话）负责。</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>10. If the said goods are transported to Hong Kong in and by different
                        shipment, the late arrival of one shipment or the failure to arrive at all
                        of the same shall not entitle the Buyer to repudiate this Contract, but the
                        Buyer shall accept such portion of the said goods which shall have arrived
                        at Hong Kong.</p>
                    <p>标的货物运往香港时，如果装船差异导致其中一批货晚到达或所有货不能同时到达，不构成买方拒绝履行本协议，买方应该接受标的货物已到达香港部分。</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>11. If the said goods shall be damaged or lost while in transit from the
                        manufacturers/suppliers to the Seller in Hong Kong or in storage before or
                        after arrival in Hong Kong, the Buyer must take delivery of the said goods
                        at an allowance to be determined by a duly qualified surveyor practicing in
                        Hong Kong to be solely appointed by the Seller.</p>
                    <p>
                        如果标的货物在制造商/供应商运往香港卖方途中或在到达香港之前或之后的储存过程中损坏或丢失，买方必须按一定折扣接受标的货物，折扣经由卖方独自指定的、在香港执业的、合乎资格的检查员确定。</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>12. The Seller shall not be liable to the Buyer for any loss or damages
                        arising out of or in connection with failure on the part of the Seller to
                        deliver or delay in delivery of the said goods or parts thereof if such
                        non‐delivery or delay shall be due to any contingencies beyond the control
                        of the Seller including but not limited to the failure of the
                        manufacturers/suppliers to supply to the Seller the same or to supply to the
                        Seller the same in time, shortage of labour, Act of God, strike, shortage of
                        raw material, war (whether declared or not), hostilities civil strike,
                        commotion, damage and loss to the said goods while in transit (whether by
                        air, sea or land transportation) from the manufacturers/suppliers to the
                        Seller; delay by carriers (whether by air sea or land), delay caused by
                        banks and go‐down in the release of the said goods, delay caused by failure
                        to comply with and/or observe rules and regulations of government agencies
                        abroad and in Hong Kong, failure to comply with terms of letters of credit
                        and/or other bank documents and/or requirements of bankers of the
                        manufacturers/suppliers.</p>
                    <p>12.
                        卖方未能交付或延误交付标的货物，如果这一未交付或交付延误是卖方无法控制的或有因素导致的，包括但不仅限于制造商/供应商未能按时提供标的货物给卖方、缺乏劳力、不可抗力、罢工、原材料短缺、战争
                        （无论公告与否）、恶意的国内罢工、骚乱、从制造商/供应商运往卖方运送途中（无论是空运、海运还是陆运）产生的损坏或遗失、银行和未能放行标的货物引起的延误、未能遵守和/或遵照国外政府机构和香港规章制度导致的延误、
                        未能遵照信用证条款和/或其他银行文件和/或制造商/供应商银行方的要求导致的延误，卖方不将为买方的任何损失或损坏负责。</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>13. Notwithstanding that credit has been given for the payment of the price
                        of the said goods, the Seller shall be entitled to retain possession thereof
                        until payment.</p>
                    <p>尽管已给予标的货物货款支付一定帐期，但卖方有权保留标的货物所有权直至付款。</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>14. In addition to any right of lien which the Seller may be law be entitled,
                        the Seller shall (in the event of the Buyer’s insolvency and/or failure to
                        make payment of the price as stipulated herein) be entitled to a general
                        lien on all the goods of the Buyer in the Seller’s possession (although such
                        goods or some of them may have been paid for) for the unpaid price of any
                        other goods sold and delivered to the Buyer by the Seller under this
                        Contract or other agreements.</p>
                    <p>
                        如果买方破产和/或无法按照协议规定付款，那么除了在法律上授权给卖方的任何留置权之外，买方所有货物的一般留置权将被授予卖方，在卖方的管理之下
                        （尽管这些货物或其中部分的货款可能已经被支付），用于任何其他按照协议或其他约定由卖方交付给买方已销售的未付款货物的货款支付。</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>15. No warranty condition description or representation on the part of the
                        Seller is given or implied by this Contract nor is any warranty condition
                        description or representation to be taken to have been given or implied from
                        anything said or written in the negotiations between the parties or their

                        condition or description express or implied as to the state quality or

                        或关于以本协议为条件的标的货物品质状况或适宜性或适销品质的其他保证条款或描述明示或暗示，在此特别指出被排除在外。</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>16. Should any dispute arise with regard to the state or quality or fitness
                        or merchantable quality or condition of the said goods or otherwise in
                        connection with the terms of this Contract, the Buyer shall nevertheless
                        take delivery of the said goods and make due payment therefore as herein
                        agreed.</p>
                    <p>不论关于标的货物的状态或品质或适宜性或适销品质或条件或与本协议有关条款相违背所产生的任何争议，买方仍然应该接受标的货物，并根据协议定期付款。</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>17. It is hereby expressly provided that the said goods delivered by the
                        Seller hereunder shall be deemed to correspond with their description if
                        they correspond with the sample (if any) which has been produced to and
                        examined by the Buyer.</p>
                    <p>如果卖方交付的标的货物的说明与已出示给买方并经买方检查过的样品（若有的话）一致，那么卖方交付的标的货物应该清楚地被认为与标的货物的说明一致。</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>18. The description hereinbefore given of the said goods has been given by
                        way of identification thereof only and the use of such description shall not
                        constitute a sale by description.</p>
                    <p>在协议中给出的有关标的货物的说明仅仅是为了辨认鉴定标的货物，这种说明的使用不应该被视为凭说明销售。</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>19. Notwithstanding that a sample of the said goods (if any) may have been
                        exhibited to and inspected by the Buyer, it is hereby declared that such
                        sample so exhibited and inspected was solely to enable the Buyer to judge
                        for itself of the quality of the bulk, and not so as to constitute a sale by
                        sample under this Contract. The Buyer shall take the said goods at its own
                        risk as to their correspondence with the said sample or as to their quality
                        condition or sufficiency for any purpose.</p>
                    <p>
                        尽管标的货物样品（若有的话）可能已经被出示并经买方检测，但是在此需要澄清的是经过证明和检测的样品仅仅是用来使买方能够自行判断桶装货物的品质，并不是为了制定在协议下凭样品销售。
                        买方应该自行承担与标的样品一致的标的货物风险，或承担标的货物品质风险，或任何目的充分理由。</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>20. The Seller will not be responsible for the quality or fitness of the said
                        goods for any purpose but the Buyer must take them on its own judgment as
                        the result of its examination of the same. Nor shall any description of the
                        said goods given by the Seller constitute a sale by description.</p>
                    <p>
                        不管出于何种目的，卖方都不将为标的货物的品质或适宜性负责。买方必须根据同样货物的测试结果自行判断并承担品质或适宜性责任。
                        卖方提供的关于标的货物的任何说明不应该视为凭说明销售。</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>21. The Seller binds itself only to the delivery of the said goods in
                        accordance with the general description under which they were sold, whether
                        or not any special or particular description shall have been given or shall
                        be implied by law. Any such special or particular description shall be taken
                        only as the expression of the Seller’s opinion in that behalf. The Seller
                        does not give any warranty as to the quality state condition or fitness of
                        the goods, which must be taken by the Buyer with all faults and
                        imperfection.</p>
                    <p>
                        卖方仅仅允诺交付的标的货物符合据此出售的一般性说明，无论是不是按照法律应该给出或暗示的任何专门的或特殊的说明。
                        任何这样的专门的或特殊的说明应该仅仅被视为卖方站在其立场上观点的表达。卖方不会针对货物的品质状况条件或合适性作出任何保证，并不保证商品没有瑕疵和不完整性，买方必须承担这些。</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>22. The Buyer shall not cancel, modify or change any term or condition hereof
                        without the Seller’s written consent. No claim or right of the Seller will
                        be waived or renounced in whole or in part unless the waiver or
                        renounciation of such claim or right is acknowledged and confirmed in
                        writing by the Seller.</p>
                    <p>
                        如果没有卖方书面同意，买方不得取消、修改或变更本协议的任何条款和条件。卖方未索赔或寻求权利将不被视为全部或局部放弃或作罢，除非这些索赔或寻求权力的放弃或作罢得到卖方的书面回执确认。</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>23. This Contract shall be governed by the laws of Hong Kong and both the
                        Seller and the Buyer irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of the Courts
                        in Hong Kong.</p>
                    <p>
                        本协议按照中华人民共和国香港特别行政区法律制定和诠释。有关由本协议引起的、与本协议有关的任何法律诉讼或起诉，买卖双方均应不可撤销地服从香港特别行政区法院的管辖和约束。</p>
